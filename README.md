Metastyle, which takes a specific vocabulary in RDF as a seed and generates a skeleton for them to create a sharable micro-theme dedicated to this vocabulary. Here, micro-themes can be shared as templates and discovered via our tool. Moreover, statistics and ranking are applied here, which can make well-designed micro-themes achievable to users more than those with low qualities. With respect to embeddable data format variations, Metastyle provides one-click transformation between micro-themes created based on different formats.
